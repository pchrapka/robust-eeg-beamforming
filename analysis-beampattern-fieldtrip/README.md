# analysis-beampattern-fieldtrip

The goal of this sub-project is to explore the beampattern of the various beamformers along a linear set of grid points.

## How to run

ftb_rmvb_pipeline
```

The output will appear in the current working directory. To avoid unnecessarily re-running the analysis choose either the current analysis subdirectory or the main project directory.
